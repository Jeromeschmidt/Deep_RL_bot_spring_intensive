# Juniors Spring Intensive Deliverable Proposal

Dates 3/16-3/25

**Jerome Schmidt**


**Deep Learning Game Bot**


**New Project**


**Solo Project**


## Description

**My goal of this intensive is to learn more about deep reinforcement learning. I feel a good way to do this is to build a deep learning bot to play a game such as tik-tak-toe. After that if there is still time left in the intensive I would like to use the bot on a different game like chess.**

**Alternative to having project live: Write a Medium article about my project and learning experience.**

## Challenges I Anticipate

**Since I am relatively new to deep reinforcement learning, I will have to learn things as I go.**

## Skateboard
**Write a tik-tak-toe game that can be played by 2 players.**

## Bike
**Build deep reinforcement learning bot to play tik-tak-toe.**

## Car
**Have bot play chess instead of tik-tak-toe.**


## Personal Achievement Goals:

1. Become more familiar with deep reinforcement learning
1. Build a good project for my portfolio
