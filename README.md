# Juniors Spring Intensive Deliverable README

Dates 3/16-3/25

**MiniMax Game Bot**


## Description

****


## Challenges I Faced

**Compute time for Connect 4 bot to make a single move could be greater than 1 hour on my laptop. Solved by using depth limitation of Minimax search and an evaluation function to significantly reduce compute time.**

## Phase 1
**Wrote versions of both tic-tac-toe and connect 4 that could be played by 2 players in the terminal.**

## Phase 2
**Build vanilla Minimax bot to play tic-tac-toe and connect 4 against a real user.**

## Car
**Implemented alpha-beta pruning to reduce compute time**

**Since the compute time for connect 4 was significant enough to reason the game was unplayable, added depth limitation and evaluations function to reduce compute time. Depending on the depth allowed, this would lessen the difficulty but that can be adjusted.**

Evaluation Formula: score = ((number of possible streaks of 4)*10 + (number of possible streaks of 3)*5 + (number of possible streaks of 2)*2)*

## Personal Achievement Goals:

1. Become more familiar with game playing bots
2. Build a good project for my portfolio
