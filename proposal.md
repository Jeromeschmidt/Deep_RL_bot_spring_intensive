# Juniors Spring Intensive Deliverable Proposal

Dates 3/16-3/25

**Jerome Schmidt**


**MiniMax Game Bot**


**New Project**


**Solo Project**


## Description

**My goal of this intensive is to learn more about Minimax and game playing algorithms general. I feel a good way to do this is to build a bot to play a game such as tic-tac-toe using the Minimax algorithm and alpha-beta pruning. After that if there is still time left in the intensive I would like to use the bot on a different game like connect 4.**


## Challenges I Anticipate

**Since I am relatively new to game playing bots, I will have to learn things as I go.**

## Skateboard
**Write a tic-tac-toe game that can be played by 2 players in the terminal.**

## Bike
**Build vanilla Minimax bot to play tic-tac-toe against a real user.**

## Car
**Have bot play connect 4 instead of tic-tac-toe with minimax that includes alpha-beta pruning.**
***Possible addition: Limit depth of search***
***Possible addition: Deep RL approach to evaluate current board position to find best next move without searching more level of the tree***


## Personal Achievement Goals:

1. Become more familiar with game playing bots
2. Build a good project for my portfolio
